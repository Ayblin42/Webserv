# WEBSERV
The Webserv project, part of the 42 School common core curriculum, challenges students to create an HTTP web server from scratch in C++98. This server must handle basic HTTP requests such as GET, POST, DELETE, HEAD, and PUT, adhering to the relevant RFC standards as closely as possible. The server should be capable of serving both static files from a specified root directory and dynamic content using CGI. Additionally, it needs to manage multiple client connections . The project encourages a deep understanding of HTTP and networking concepts, offering specific instructions while allowing room for discovering and understanding its subtleties.

# Usage
```bash
make
./webserv [Config File] ## leave empty to use the default configuration.
```
